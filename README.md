## Info

This project is a fork of Ian Finlayson's GBA Tile Editor. The goal of
this fork is to update the existing codebase and add features to the
existing program. As of writing this, the project was just recently forked
and has not been renamed or anything yet, as the original project has been
untouched for the last two years.

## Features
